The Development Framework is a framework for standardizing and simplifying processes of building applications by automating mechanisms for data and process modeling, data storage, front-end development and analysis orchestration. 

## Overview

The framework consists of several services, tools, libraries, and applications to be used in the development of applications.

### Services

* [Data modeling storage service] is a service used for storing and querying blueprints and entities.
* [Data modeling job API] is a service for scheduling and running jobs using blueprints.

### Tools

* [Data modeling CLI] is a command-line interface (CLI) that can be used to
  * Import and export blueprints and entities to the [data modeling storage service].
* [Create data modeling app] is used to create new data modelling apps with just one command!

### Packages

* [Data modeling core packages] contains published [libraries](/docs/category/libraries) like the core frontend package and UI plugins.
